# ExoCore-Kernel

**WARNING**: This prerelease is one of the first kernels generated by ChatGPT o3 and o4-mini. It is unstable and may contain bugs. Do not run on real hardware; use QEMU or a virtual machine.

**NOTICE**: The `linkdep` folder is where you may place your .h or .c, and any scripts calling these functions will be referenced.

**COPYRIGHT NOTICE**:
This project was generated by an AI system.
To the extent any copyright applies, it is released under the MIT License.
Otherwise, it is dedicated to the public domain (CC0).

## Features

**ExoDraw**

full VGA text mode graphical interface module, that can draw a simple VGA GUI.

**MicroPython**

Run real MicroPython scripts and ELF binaries on exocore, completely modular, so no need to recompile to swap a binary. (With importable kernel modules)

**Memory handler**

A very simple but kind of functional memory handler

**Actual user space mode**

Swapping rings and enforcing protections.

## Prerequisites

Install the following on Ubuntu (or a similar Linux distribution):

* Cross‑compiler (e.g. `x86_64-elf-gcc`)
* Binutils cross tools (`x86_64-elf-ld`)
* NASM (for assembly modules)
* `grub-mkrescue` and `mtools` (required for ISO generation)
* `qemu-system-x86_64` (or your emulator of choice)
* `make`, `bash`, and standard Unix utilities

## Building

1. Clone the repository and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ExoCore-Kernel/ExoCore-Kernel.git
   cd ExoCore-Kernel
   ```

2. Adjust `build.sh` if your cross‑toolchain is installed in a nonstandard location.

3. Make the script executable and run it:

   ```bash
   chmod +x build.sh
   ./build.sh
   ```

   When executed, `build.sh` simply builds the kernel. Run `./update.sh` beforehand if you wish to fetch the latest kernel and Micropython sources.

   This will clean previous builds, compile the kernel stub, package MicroPython modules from `run/`, link with GRUB, and produce `exocore.iso`.

## Running in QEMU

To build and launch QEMU in one step:

```bash
./build.sh run
```

Use the optional `nographic` parameter to run QEMU without a graphical window:

```bash
./build.sh run nographic
```

Alternatively, after building, run QEMU manually:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom exocore.iso -m 128M
```

## Adding Your Own Code

1. Place your Python file (e.g. `myapp.py`) into the `run/` directory.
2. Rebuild with `./build.sh`; the script packages these MicroPython modules automatically.
3. Select your new module in QEMU via the boot menu or launch it directly.

## Contributing

* Open issues for bug reports or feature requests.
* Submit pull requests for improvements, new modules, or documentation updates.
* Follow the existing code style (K\&R C, minimal dependencies).
